Inkscape tutorials
==================

Since there are people that make their living by working with inkscape I figured there were better tutorials 
already available on the web than what I could come up with.

One of the most common issues in inkscape is making arrows.  Although, it is a little work once you have made one 
then you can save it and use it for all future derivative arrows.

One nice aspect of inkscape is how easy it is to trace a bitmap.

* Try having a look at the `Donate button tutorial <http://verysimpledesigns.com/vectors/inkscape-tutorial-donate-button.html>`_
  you can download the svg and open it in inkscape.
